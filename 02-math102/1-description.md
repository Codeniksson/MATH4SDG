# MATH 102 - Elementary Calculus II

## Objectives and Content

### Objectives
The course contains theory of linear algebra for use in solving differential equations, data analysis, and optimization.

### Content
In this course, systems of linear equations, determinants, matrix algebra, eigenvalues, and vectors are studied. Furthermore, an introduction to differential equations, systems of homogeneous linear differential equations, population dynamic models, and functions of several variables are provided. An introduction to the programs MATLAB and NumPy will be given, which will be used in exercises. Numerical solutions of algebraic and differential equations will be a central theme.
